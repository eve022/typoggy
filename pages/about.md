I chose to explore this theme for typography because, I thought that as consumers a type of writing we are always taking in is that from food companies. I think that there is a lot to be said for what connection our eating habits have with what brand we associate with. I wanted to know how companies attract us with their typography in something as everyday as fast food.  

I researched typography jargon and tropes. I then analysed the semantics of the brand's identities and looked at articles and the history of the restaurant's staple styles. I chose my fast-food restaurants based off popularity and how iconic they are. This way I could compare some of the characteristics and understand more behind the design of successful branding.  

I would say overall my food blog is aimed at anyone who wants to learn about typography or people interested in food. As it’s accessible on phones as well as laptops it attracts a younger audience as well as the 25–30-year-olds who typically read blogs.
