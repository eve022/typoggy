**Burger King.** Burger King have gone back to their old routes. Doing a rebrand this year by going back to their 1970s -1990s logo. Talk about vintage branding! The logo which once featured a blue half circle wrapped around two yellow, bun like, semi circles with the large red Burger King writing has been trashed. As the brand redesigned Lisa Smith claims in an interview with Deezen. That they are moving toward improving their “quailing and taste” and the old logo needed to be changed in order for the public to have a different perception of them. 

The new logo or I guess old logo you can call it, is much more simplistic. With two brown semi circles sandwiching the classic red “Flame Sans” which is owned by Burger King and was a signature font used in the 70s. 

A big part of the logo was removing the blue circle, which Smith says was symbolistic of the “removal of colours, flavours and preservatives from artificial sources.”

The new font is much more playful and stylish than the old and the red and brown colour palette evokes a more flame grilled and rustic style of food. 

As more people are looking for healthier options when it comes to fast food this was a step in the right direction in order to compete with giants such as McDonald’s.

**Five guys.** Five Guys burgers and Fries is an American fast-food restaurant that’s focused on serving diner style burgers, hot dogs and milkshakes. The sans serif font used in the main logo is Helvetica black. It sits on a white background and is in a dark red colour. The subtitle “burgers and fries” featured in some logos and menu items is in Tekton Bold. The informal handwriting font designed by David Siegel adds a homely, honest and family friendly typographic voice to the brand. And the Helvetica, which is used by big brands like McDonald’s, showing how the brand is trying to compete as an American burger place in the UK. 

Five guys strive to look retro. As they are based on an American Diner that started in Virginia from humble beginnings. The importance of creating a retro theme throughout their restaurant is key for the appeal of guests. Customers may go to take pictures and pose in front of the red and white checker wall which is a staple of their restaurants. 

As for the typography of the logo, the weight is high and the contrast is low, as the red stands out on the plain background with no interruptions or background noise.
