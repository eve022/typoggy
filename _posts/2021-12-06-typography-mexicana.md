**Taco Bell.** The Taco bell logo is a growingly popular icon for Mexican food across the UK and USA. With over 7,000 locations in the U.S this fast-food chain is spreading quickly. The Bell in the logo is obviously it’s signature icon, placed on a purple background the clean white bell almost looks like a cut out. The Bell holds ohmage to the founder Glen Bell. Underneath this is the black nameplate, uniform and bold, in a smart sans-serif typeface with clean traditional contours. The font they used up until 2016 was Corpus Gothic Alternative, quite an expensive font. But it then was replaced to a minimalist sans serif font as the gothic font was outdated. The font has a low contrast and low width but a thick weight to it, making it bold yet simplistic. Even though the Bell features a combination of two shades of purple, light and dark, the wordmark is in plain black. Connoting it’s aimed more toward adults and young adults as the logo is sophisticated, for a fast-food restaurant. The modern typeface and purple colour palette are what separates Taco Bell from other fast-food chains. As it’s less well known in the UK, an American fast-food restaurant that isn’t aimed at families like the other ones might be appealing to more adult consumers.
