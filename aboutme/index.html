      <h2>What do I enjoy?</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy listening to music and meeting new people. I also like playing squash I play for my university as women's team captian. I enjoy the media elements of my course the most. Finding semiotics and codes is something I’m very good at, and I think I will go into advertising in the future because building brand campaigns is something I’m fascinated by. </p>

      <h2>Where am I from?</h2>
      <p>I grew up in South East London in a place called Forest Hill. Then when I was 14 I moved to Hastings a seaside town. However, if we're talking genetically, I'm a quarter Turkish , a quarter South african and then the rest is some variation of English.</p>

      <h3>My creativity</h3>
      <p>My dad and I are both independent film makers and I’ve made numerous short movies with my friends that have been shown to many audiences as a part of my dad's film company. My favourite film that I've starred in however is one when I was much younger because it's like a little time capsule. It reminds me of how much I've grown over the years.</p>

       <h4>What I do on the weekends</h4>
      <p class="frame">
        Seeing as I'm a university student I go out with my friends a lot. Clubbing, drum and bass and rave culture is a big part of my personality. This year I picked up being a DJ after standing in awe at many festivals and gigs wanting to know how. Here is linked my favourite song.
